GymPass (Arduino Component)
===========================

**GymPass** is a Arduino based RFID access control system.

It is designed to run with (but can run without) a web server to authenticate users, live audit access attempts, accept remote unlock commands, and more as I write it.

I designed this for the village gym at the mine site where I work, to help stop the anonymous theft of gym equipment.

Supported hardware
------------------

I wrote this for the following hardware, not too hard to make it work with similar/more.

- Freetronics EtherTen
- Freetronics RFID Lock Shield
- Micro SD Card

I'll put some system schematics up soon.
